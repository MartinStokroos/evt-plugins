# EVT-based response box (RSP-12x) plug-in

The RSP_PYGAME plug-in handles input from RSP-12x devices. The RSP_PYGAME uses the joystick module of PyGame for flawless integration with OpenSesame 4. Please use the PyGame engine for the OpenSesame project.

## Connecting multiple RSP-12x (or EVT-x) devices

In the device selection tab, select the right device number. The RSP-12x ID-numbers displayed, are in random order, but will remain the same as long devices are not plugged in or out during the session! Test your program to make sure you are using the right input device.

## Options and response variables

The RSP_PYGAME plug-in works analogously to the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE item. For more information, see the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE-item help or visit:
